title: Renaissance Scholar
---

The [Renaissance Scholar](https://ahf.usc.edu/commencement-honors/scholar-distinctions/renaissance/) distinction is intended to recognize and celebrate USC undergraduates who have excelled academically while pursuing at least two widely separate fields of study.

I achieved this recognition for my simultaneous commitment to a <strong>Computer Engineering & Computer Science major</strong> and a <strong>Themed Entertainment minor</strong>.
