---

The [GCSP Scholar Distinction](https://viterbiundergrad.usc.edu/gcsp/) at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering is a prestigious recognition awarded to undergraduate students who have demonstrated a commitment to addressing the National Academy of Engineering's (NAE) Grand Challenges. These challenges encompass critical global issues in areas such as sustainability, health, security, and the joy of living.

To earn this distinction, students engage in a combination of curricular and co-curricular activities throughout their undergraduate studies, focusing on five key competencies known as the "Five Mindsets":
1. <strong>Talent/Research</strong>: Conducting research or engaging in projects related to a Grand Challenge.
2. <strong>Multidisciplinary</strong>: Gaining knowledge across multiple disciplines to approach problems holistically.
3. <strong>Entrepreneurship</strong>: Understanding how to translate research into viable business solutions.
4. <strong>Multicultural Competence</strong>: Acquiring global perspectives through experiences that enhance cultural understanding.
5. <strong>Social Consciousness</strong>: Demonstrating a commitment to societal improvement through service or outreach.

During their senior year, students apply for the GCSP designation by submitting a narrative that reflects on their experiences related to each of these mindsets. A review committee evaluates the applications to determine eligibility.
