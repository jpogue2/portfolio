In 2023, I was fortunate to receive a scholarship to attend the [International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Expo](https://iaapa.org/expos-and-events/iaapa-expo) through the [Big Break Foundation's Ignite Talent Program](https://www.bigbreakfoundation.org/ignitetalent). The experience was transformative, and it quickly became one of my top goals to bring Scream USC to IAAPA.

Over the course of 2024, I worked closely with [USC's Undergraduate Student Government](https://usg.usc.edu/) and <strong>successfully secured $6,000 in funding</strong>, enough to <strong>send seven members</strong> to the next IAAPA Expo. As the event approached, I coordinated with travel agencies to book flights and hotel rooms and ensured that all attendees had IAAPA registration and tickets.

In November 2024, our group traveled to IAAPA, where members of Scream USC had the chance to explore the industry firsthand. Several secured internships through connections made at the expo, and Scream USC as a whole expanded its network. One especially meaningful connection was with the president and founder of the [Melanin Coaster Network (MCN)](https://www.melanincoasternetwork.org/), who later partnered with us to provide exclusive backstage tours at Los Angeles local theme parks.
