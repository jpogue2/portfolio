At first, we relied solely on Google Drive to stay organized. Tasks were tracked in a shared Google Sheet, but the system quickly became difficult for anyone to maintain. Having already completed a professional internship, I was familiar with industry-standard tools like Jira. But for a student organization, Jira felt too complex and heavy-handed.

Instead, we found a middle ground with Notion. Over the summer, I designed a comprehensive Notion workspace tailored to our needs, including meeting notes, project planning, marketing timelines, task management, and other key logistics. The system was adopted enthusiastically and has remained active and up-to-date ever since.
