The only thing better than going on an attraction is watching someone discover how much they love them. Some of my proudest moments in Scream USC have come from <strong>helping friends find a passion</strong> they didn’t know they had.

Many of our executive board members started out simply enjoying theme parks casually. They weren’t initially considering careers in the themed entertainment industry. But through <strong>countless conversations, shared experiences, and encouragement</strong>, I helped them see a path forward: nudging them to attend industry mixers, submit that first internship application, or take a chance on a creative ambition.

Today, I’m incredibly proud that <strong>five members</strong> of the Scream USC executive board have accepted positions at leading companies in the field, including <strong>Knott’s Berry Farm, Universal Creative, and Walt Disney Imagineering</strong>. Knowing I played a part in their journey is deeply meaningful and a true reflection of Scream USC’s mission in action.
