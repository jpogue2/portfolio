During my freshman year, I began organizing monthly trips to Six Flags Magic Mountain with a large group of friends. Some enjoyed it so much that they never missed a visit, and it made me wonder <strong>how many other students shared our passion for roller coasters</strong>.

That question sparked the idea for a student organization dedicated to amusement parks. When I shared it with others, I was met with enthusiasm and encouragement. I drafted a constitution, secured a faculty advisor, gained initial approval from USC, and did some preliminary brainstorming.

I then invited three close friends: <strong>[Olivia Owyang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-owyang/), [Gabriela Gutzmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielagutzmer/), and [Varun Punater](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varun-punater-377537170/)</strong>, to join me as the founding executive board. Together, we launched the organization in January 2023 and hit the ground running.
