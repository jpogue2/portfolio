This issue didnâ€™t surface until the system was fully integrated. But by that point, several sources of audio delay had become apparent.

Initially, the speaker was controlled directly by the Arduino Mega via a [serial MP3 player module](https://www.amazon.com/DIYables-Player-Arduino-ESP8266-Raspberry/dp/B0CF593SWY/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2ZK4QLLU1WFNI&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.lRuqJ9HfGuzoeMdWgV2YTNwgNaJyT9CaAabNKzMa4YOrMrfLHXImI9gwZMEznqsOESiw3k-42NTMOFHws0jf5KIqSceAq9YIaejra0ATFQJNSChiSB8Z8DQiWhG5MlpqbTZHI0ZSVM2-yCHxkzBs15v7I_gQpZfjX2-8qVXglAYjMcY6_ScYg7vfdA7sPU3-g4XnxYIRGSKe3qbdm7wZYC948KQURE5qjw0mE3Bhi7s.8Uf6KMjaGsPMECScV1CoSgZyKica62KjWxsgg5W9O1I&dib_tag=se&keywords=arduino+to+3.5mm+mp3&qid=1748213654&sprefix=arduino+to+3.5mm+mp%2Caps%2C149&sr=8-5). These modules require MP3 files to be preloaded onto a microSD card and accept traditional commands like Play, Next, and Back. However, the onboard processor introduces noticeable latency when handling these commands, resulting in a delay between when a step is triggered and when the corresponding tone is played.

Further delay came from the software-implemented SPI communication with the RFID readers, as described in the previous section. While this bit-banged SPI allowed for reliable long-distance communication, scanning all readers could take up to 4 seconds. Because the Arduino Mega is single-threaded, this would sometimes delay tone playback by several seconds.

To reduce these delays, I implemented three key solutions:
1. <strong>Replaced the MP3 module with a Python script:</strong> By routing audio playback through a Python script over serial (at 9600 baud), the system became significantly more responsive.
2. <strong>Reduced RFID polling frequency:</strong> Instead of scanning continuously, RFID readers are polled every 10 seconds. This has minimal impact on gameplay, as players typically take longer than that to place a step and prepare for the next action.
3. <strong>Paused scanning during final play:</strong> Once the steps are arranged correctly, RFID scanning is suspended until the game is reset. This ensures that audio feedback is immediate during the most crucial and satisfying moment: the player's victory attempt.
